OVERVIEW
--------

Mupload provides a file field (and image field) widget that wraps
a Plupload form element. This means multiple file uploads across
a wide range of browsers.

For a file field (or image field) use the Mupload widget instead of 
the default File (or Image) widget.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

A fully configured Plupload installation (remember the plupload javascript library).

CREDITS
-------

Credits goes to czigor for his "Multiupload Filefield Widget", without
which I would have spend a lot more time figuring out the Drupal 7
file field mechanics.

Check it out here: http://drupal.org/sandbox/czigor/1115362

Also, naturally, the Plupload module (http://drupal.org/project/plupload), without
which I would have had to do it myself.

Finally, my employer, Operate IT, for making the time available.
