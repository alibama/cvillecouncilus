DESCRIPTION
===========
This module allows users to earn points when they invite someone, and when the
invitees register. The module creates a bridge between User Points and Invite,
allowing certain invitation related actions to grant or take away points from
the user.

Userpoints Invite adds a new set of options to Points Settings at
Configuration > People > Points. Points can be awarded to the inviter for
inviting someone, and when the invitee joins the site. Invitees can receive
points for signing up, if they use an invitation to do so. The points the
inviter receives for getting someone to register can be taken away when the
invitee's account is deleted. A Userpoints category can be set up for points
awarded by Userpoints Invite.
